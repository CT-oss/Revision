(everything I have for now)

Ai was used to generate the questions and the code

# How to access the quizes

If you do not have python installed / dont want to / dont know how to, you can either follow an tutorial such as 

https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-python-windows/

or you can use

https://www.online-python.com/

as the terminal.

You need to download the script corrisponding to the notes you want to cover, you then run the file either in a command line or using the python application. Due to the scripts being simple, they can run in any terminal. 

Message me if there is a question wrong / bug in the code
